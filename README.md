This is a lighter version of Github, proposed by a job challenge.

Challenge
A description of what is expected and what I marked as I could possibly do.

Requisites
 Connect to Github API;

 List all public repositories from an user (first version: reactjs user);

 List all the last 20 commits of repo after being clicked;

 Commits list should have a search field;

Bonus Tasks
 Use some modern css solution (CSS Modules, Styled-components, etc);

 Endless scrolling for the commits page;

 Make it possible to change the order the repositories are shown (By stars, name, etc);

 Component Library (Storybook.js, Styleguidist, etc);

 Server side rendering;

Solution
 Use reactjs, you can start with a simple create-react-app structure and work from there;

 Use some state managing solution;

 Use ES6+ features and write down in the readme why you used and for what, for at least 2 of them;

 Write unit tests and any other test you may find helpful or important to have;

 Keep performance and corner cases in mind;

 Be creative and show us what you got;

Personal Bonus Tasks
 List events;

 Search user repo;

 Search repo;

 Search user;

Stack
It will be used:

CRA: The most common React boilerplate

ReactJS: A modern web development framework

Redux: For state management

Github API: The API that the project is connected

Material-UI: The most popular React UI framework - Removed, theming functions changed to styled-components

Styled-Components: Styles CSS as a component

TypeScript: Typed superset of JavaScript - Removed, added to scope NextJS (it's already hard work)

Jest: A JavaScript testing framework

Storybook: Its a components exposed book

This is the main stack of the project, it will be based on scalability (not as a simple challenge!)

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm dev
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

yarn build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.
